### Changing Content With AJAX
![Logo](images/logo.png)
### Introduction
Use SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. Use Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.

Check out the :arrow_right:[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuQ30JRoqKKT1aAFCiQQ1I-YMIc0i4zM3qRs9zhA0mM/edit?usp=sharing) for this project!

## Getting Started
:heavy_exclamation_mark:IMPORTANT:heavy_exclamation_mark:: Import `mini_models.sql` inside `includes` folder before opening `index.html` to check stuff out. For things to work, database's name has to be `mini_models` and table's name has to be `tbl_models`!
- Clone this project into your `localhost` root folder.
- Before opening `index.html`, make sure to import the database inside `includes` folder. (:heavy_exclamation_mark:Check out IMPORTANT message before installing!)
- You're ready! Check the website out by opening `index.html` with a browser that works well with interactive and responsive designs. (Check out [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)).
- Check out the codes by using a Code Editor: [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
